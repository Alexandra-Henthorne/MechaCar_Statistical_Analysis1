Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

* ground clearance and MPG

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No because the p-value is greater than .05 

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

I want to say yes becayse the r value is showing that 70 percent of the data is being used I believe

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

I would say no because only three lots  came up meeting the requirments.
