Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

* ground clearance and MPG

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No because the p-value is greater than .05 

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

I want to say yes becayse the r value is showing that 70 percent of the data is being used I believe
